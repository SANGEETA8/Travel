    <p>Steeped in religious mythology, legends and heritage, Uttarakhand is home to a number of revered temples, holy rivers and spiritual sites. Devotees flock to here for pilgrimages to Char Dham (four religious centres namely Kedarnath, Badrinath, Yamunotri and Gangotri) and to Panch Prayag, the confluence of rivers in five sites that ultimately form River Ganga, one of India’s most sacred rivers and worshipped as a goddess, along with visits to several other destinations of religious importance (like Bageshwar, Joshimath, Baijnath to name a few) in the state that is also referred to as the land of pilgrims.</p>
